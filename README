1 Introduction

The nhl-network code is a short python code that can be used to create and
to analyze an affiliation network of NHL players. In this network any players
who have been teammates are linked. This is similar to Hollywood actor network
where any actors are linked if they appeared in the same movie. 
This network has Kevin Bacon as somewhat of a central node.

The code:
   - Downloads player data from http://www.databasehockey.com/
     and uses Beautiful Soup to extract the data from the web pages.
   - Uses the data to create a list of Player and Team objects.
   - Calculates various metrics related to the graph.
   - Outputs the network in a .gml file.

Files included:

  - Python files:
      - nhl-affiliation-network.py The main code
      - utils.py Utility functions that are needed when running the main code
                 
  - README-file

------------------------------------------------------

2 Installation and dependencies

The code depends on the following python libraries:
   - BeautifulSoup
   - Matplotlib
   - NetworkX
   - Numpy
   - requests

No installation is needed. The program uses Infomap to find clusters of nodes
in the network. Infomap can be downloaded from http://www.mapequation.org/.
The code uses subprocess call function to call the compiled Infomap to find
the clusters.

Current version has been tested in Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu 10.04 but it
should work also in other operating systems. Code has been developed using
python-2.6.5.

------------------------------------------------------

3 Running

Typing 'python nhl-affiliation-network.py' runs the code. The code can be
customized to use an already downloaded player database to construct
the network. Otherwise it will try to dowload the data from the online pages.
The initial and last years are currently set aas 1917 and 2009, respectively.
This can be changed, but with the default values the program will download
all the player data from the site.

The infomap clustering can be disable.

The current program prints to the screen some information of the evaluation
process. During the download process the program prints the name of the team
that is being downloaded.

------------------------------------------------------

4 Output

The program outputs a simplified version of the network in pajek form to
the folder where Infomap is located. This file is then analyzed by Infomap.
The more detailed network is written as a gml file. This file
incorporates results of the Infomap clustering and detailed information
on the players.
